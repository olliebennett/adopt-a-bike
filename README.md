Adopt a Bike
============

Adopt a Barclays Bike!

1. Find a bike you like.

2. Take a photo (with the bike).

3. Upload the details (bike's ~~number~~ name and photo)!

4. Track how far your bike travels.

5. Compete against your friends (if you have any).

6. Get alerts when your bike is nearby, or visits your home station.
